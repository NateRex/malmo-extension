malmo-extension is a project that builds upon [Microsoft's Malmo Platform](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/). It contains wrappers and utility functions for more intuitive mission design. Additionally, logs are automatically generated for each mission, providing a medium for training AI. The project currently only supports Python.
